You probably got here because Photoshop sent you here.

To communicate commands with ComfyUI, the ComfyPhotoshop Plugin needs a python server hook.
Since the plugin can't start said server itself, you'll have to bear this heavy task.

Simply click on "START THE PYTHON HOOK" to start it.


If you're starting the first time, this can take a moment, because dependancies need to be installed.

Have fun!
